SPForm is a simple, spam-proof contact form for MODX. It is, for the most part, self-installing and self-configuring in MODX Revolution.

SPForm has many options for detecting and preventing spammers from submitting spurious emails at your site.
 
In order to make SPForm easy to install and use, it is somewhat limited in the extent to which you can customize the contact form.
